Lists, why would you need them?
Congratulations! At this point in the course you are already familiar with:

Vectors (one dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in a vector all have the same data type.
Matrices (two dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in a matrix all have the same data type.
Data frames (two-dimensional objects): can hold numeric, character or logical values. Within a column all elements have the same data type, but different columns can be of different data type.
Pretty sweet for an R newbie, right? ;-)
