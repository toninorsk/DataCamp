Creating a list
Let us create our first list! To construct a list you use the function list():

my_list <- list(comp1, comp2 ...)
The arguments to the list function are the list components. Remember, these components can be matrices, vectors, other lists, ...

Instructions

# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10
my_vector <- 1:10 

# Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)

# First 10 elements of the built-in data frame mtcars
my_df <- mtcars[1:10,]

# Construct list with these different elements:
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)
