Analyze matrices, you shall
It is now time to get your hands dirty. In the following exercises you will analyze the box office numbers of the Star Wars franchise. May the force be with you!

In the editor, three vectors are defined. Each one represents the box office numbers from the first three Star Wars movies. The first element of each vector indicates the US box office revenue, the second element refers to the Non-US box office (source: Wikipedia).

In this exercise, you'll combine all these figures into a single vector. Next, you'll build a matrix from this vector.

Instructions
100 XP

Use c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi) to combine the three vectors into one vector. Call this vector box_office.
Construct a matrix with 3 rows, where each row represents a movie. Use the matrix() function to do this. The first argument is the vector box_office, containing all box office figures. Next, you'll have to specify nrow = 3 and byrow = TRUE. Name the resulting matrix star_wars_matrix.
